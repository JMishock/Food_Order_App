This is an app created through Udemy course "React-The Complete Guide(incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) 
by Maximilian Schwarzmuller.

Running the attached code You can use the attached code simply to compare it to yours. But you can also run it. To run my code, navigate into a specific code snapshot folder via the cd command in your command prompt or terminal first. Then run npm install to install all required dependencies (this will create a /node_modules folder). Run npm start to pull up application on your computer. Important: You always download the entire branch content!

Important: If you're using the code for a module that requires API keys or a backend (e.g. the module about sending Http requests), you'll have to use your backend URLs or API keys. Mine won't work (I disabled my projects)

This food app let's the user order food from a menu.
The user can select any amount of four choices of food.
The user selects how many of each item they want and selects the "+Add" button.
The user then can go to the "Your Cart" button to see their total.
The "Your Cart" button executes a modal to appear where the user can see their total, add or remove items, and place their order.

This application is more complex than the others I have made in that there are many folders and steps in order to make a quality food ordering app.
This app taught me how to organize food orders into an app along with CSS, adding and removing food items, adding a functioning food order cart,
useState hooks, executable buttons, show/hide cart handlers, react, etc.
